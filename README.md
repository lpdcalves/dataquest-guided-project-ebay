# Guided Project: Exploring eBay Car Sales Data

This repo contains an implementation of Dataquest's [Exploring eBay Car Sales](https://app.dataquest.io/c/54/m/294/guided-project%3A-exploring-ebay-car-sales-data/) Data Guided Project.

This project was initially developed in a jupyter notebook, and then transformed into a python script, both of which are available in the repo.

TODO: commands used to check (pylint) and adapt (pep8) the code.
